The project creates a theremin, using computer vision
The theremin creates sound based on the position of the index fingers of both hands (the hand to the left controls volume, the hand to the right controls the pitch of the sound)
The interface shows the lines, that represent the arms of a real-life theremin - one for volume (the closer to it the hand gets, the quieter the theremin is) and one for the pitch (the closer to the line the hand gets, the higher the pitch)

The project requires the following libraries to be installed:
mediapipe
cv2
numpy
scipy
pygame

To run the project, you must install these libraries and start the 'main.py' file, to close it, you should stop 'main.py'.
